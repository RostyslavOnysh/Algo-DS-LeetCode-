Imagine you're a treasure hunter exploring a cave filled with unique artifacts. Your goal is to find the longest path within the cave without ever stepping on the same artifact twice. As you navigate through the cave, you need a strategy to keep track of the artifacts you've already encountered to avoid retracing your steps.

In a similar fashion, given a string of characters, your mission is to find the longest substring without any repeating characters. This can be thought of as exploring a "cave of characters" where you're traversing through the string while maintaining a sliding window that captures the unique characters you've encountered so far.
```java
class Solution {
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
int n = s.length();
int maxLength = 0;
int[] lastIndex = new int[128];

        for (int start = 0, end = 0; end < n; end++) {
            char currentChar = s.charAt(end);
            start = Math.max(start, lastIndex[currentChar]);
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
            lastIndex[currentChar] = end + 1;
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

# Approach:
* Initialize variables:
n is the length of the input string s.
maxLength keeps track of the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
lastIndex is an integer array of size 128 (ASCII character set) that stores the last index where each character was seen.
* Iterate through the string with two pointers, start and end, representing the sliding window.
For each character currentChar at index end:
* Update the start pointer to the maximum of its current value and lastIndex[currentChar]. This ensures that we correctly adjust the starting position of the sliding window to avoid repeating characters.
* Update the maxLength by calculating end - start + 1. 
* Update lastIndex[currentChar] to end + 1 to mark the latest position of the character.
* Return maxLength as the result.
# Complexity:
1. Time Complexity: The algorithm iterates through the input string once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
2. Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(128), which simplifies to O(1), as the lastIndex array has a fixed size of 128 (assuming ASCII characters).
# Why is this code better than other approaches?
This code is better than other approaches because it efficiently solves the problem using the sliding window technique with optimized character tracking. By using the lastIndex array, the code reduces the number of operations, avoids unnecessary set operations, and maintains the sliding window logic. The solution's time complexity is linear and the space complexity is minimal. It's a concise, elegant, and standard solution for finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
