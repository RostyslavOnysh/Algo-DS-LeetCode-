Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
Return the integer as the final result.
Note:

Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.


Example 1:

Input: s = "42"
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.

Understanding the myAtoi function:

This code implements the myAtoi function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer, similar to the C/C++ atoi function. Here's a breakdown of the code and its components:

Fields:

index (int): This variable keeps track of the current position in the string as we iterate through it.
sign (int): This variable stores the sign (1 for positive, -1 for negative) of the resulting integer.
total (int): This variable accumulates the final integer value as we convert digits to numbers.
Algorithm:

Skip leading spaces: The code iterates through the string while the character at the current index is a space, incrementing index until a non-whitespace character is encountered.
Capture sign (optional): If the next character is '-' or '+', the sign is set accordingly. The index is then incremented to skip the sign character.
Extract digits: The code iterates through the remaining string until a non-digit character is encountered:
Convert digit: The ASCII value of the current character is subtracted by '0' to get the numerical value of the digit.
Overflow check: Before adding the digit to the total, the code performs an overflow check. This ensures that the resulting integer doesn't exceed the maximum or minimum value of a 32-bit signed integer. If overflow is detected, the function returns the appropriate value (Integer.MAX_VALUE or Integer.MIN_VALUE) depending on the sign.
Build total: If no overflow occurs, the digit is multiplied by 10 (to account for its place value) and added to the total variable.
Move to next character: The index is incremented to move to the next character in the string.
Return result: Finally, the function returns the total multiplied by the sign to ensure the correct sign for the final integer.
