```java package codeWars;

public class Cockroach {
    public int cockroachSpeed(double x){
        double ceil = Math.round(x * 27.7778);
        return (int) ceil;
    }
}
```
# Explanation:

The given code involves a class named Cockroach that contains a method cockroachSpeed. 
* This method takes a speed in kilometers per hour (x) as input and converts it to centimeters per second, while rounding down the result to the nearest integer.

The conversion factor from kilometers per hour to centimeters per second is approximately 27.7778, as stated in the code comments.

x * 27.7778: This calculation converts the speed from kilometers per hour to centimeters per second. For instance, if the input is 1.08 km/h, the result would be approximately 30 cm/s.
Math.round(...): This function is used to round the calculated value to the nearest integer. This step is essential for ensuring that the result adheres to the requirement of being an integer.
(int) ceil: Finally, the rounded value is cast to an integer, and this integer value is returned as the output of the cockroachSpeed method.
Task Explanation:

The task involves converting the speed of a cockroach from kilometers per hour to centimeters per second. The goal is to create a function that takes the speed in km/h as input and returns the speed in cm/s as an integer (floored, or rounded down).

For example, if the input is 1.08 km/h, the expected output is 30 cm/s.

# Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this code is constant or O(1). The calculations involved are straightforward arithmetic operations that don't depend on the input size.

# Space Complexity:

The space complexity is also constant or O(1) since only a constant amount of memory is used to store variables and perform calculations.

In summary, this code converts the speed of a cockroach from kilometers per hour to centimeters per second while rounding down to the nearest integer. It achieves this through simple mathematical operations and adheres to the provided task requirements.
