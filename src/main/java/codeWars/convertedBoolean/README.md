```java public class ConvertBooleanToString {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean b = true;
        String bool = boolToWord(b);
        System.out.println(bool);
    }

    public static String boolToWord(boolean b) {
        return b ? "Yes" : "No";
    }
}
```
# Explanation:

The given code defines a class named ConvertBooleanToString that contains a main method and another method called boolToWord.

* The main method is the entry point of the program. It initializes a boolean variable b with the value true, and then it calls the boolToWord method with this boolean value as an argument.
* The resulting string is stored in the bool variable. Finally, it prints the value of bool to the console.
* The boolToWord method takes a boolean parameter b and returns a string "Yes" if the boolean value is true, and "No" if the boolean value is false. This is achieved using the ternary conditional operator.
* If b is true, the expression evaluates to "Yes", and if b is false, it evaluates to "No".
Task Explanation:

The task involves converting a boolean value (true or false) to a string representation. The goal is to create a function that takes a boolean as input and returns a string "Yes" if the boolean is true, and "No" if the boolean is false.

For example, if the input boolean is true, the expected output is "Yes".

# Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this code is constant or O(1). The execution time is not dependent on the input value, as the operations performed are straightforward.

# Space Complexity:

The space complexity is also constant or O(1) because only a small amount of memory is used to store variables, and the memory usage does not grow with the input size.

# In summary :
this code converts a boolean value to a string representation ("Yes" or "No") based on the provided task requirements. It accomplishes this using a ternary conditional operator, and the time and space complexities are both constant.
