        if (n <= 0 || m <= 0) {

# The ChocolateBar class : 
* contains a static method breakChocolate that takes two integer parameters, n and m, representing the dimensions of a chocolate bar.
* The if statement checks if either n or m is less than or equal to 0. If either dimension is not positive, it returns 0 immediately, indicating that there is no chocolate to break.
* If both dimensions are positive, the method proceeds to calculate the minimum number of breaks required to separate the chocolate into individual pieces. The formula (n * m) - 1 computes this value. The -1 is subtracted because the last break doesn't create two separate pieces; it represents the final separation.
* The commented-out line at the end demonstrates a more concise version of the return statement using the ternary conditional operator. It has the same logic as the preceding if statement. If either dimension is less than or equal to 0, the result is 0. Otherwise, it calculates (n * m) - 1.

 
# The time complexity of the given algorithm is O(1)
which is constant time complexity. This means that the time it takes to run the algorithm is not dependent on the input size (in this case, the values of n and m). The reason for this is that the algorithm consists of simple arithmetic operations (multiplication and subtraction), and it performs the same number of operations regardless of the input values.

* No matter how large the values of n and m are, the algorithm performs a fixed number of operations to compute the result: checking if the values are positive or zero, performing multiplication, and then performing subtraction. As a result, the algorithm's time complexity remains constant, or O(1).

* In terms of space complexity, the algorithm uses a constant amount of space to store the input parameters and some local variables for calculations. Therefore, the space complexity is also O(1), indicating that the memory usage does not grow with the size of the input.

# In summary : 
this code determines the minimum number of breaks necessary to split a chocolate bar into individual pieces, taking into account the dimensions n rows and m columns. It handles cases where the dimensions are invalid (non-positive) and provides the correct result when the dimensions are valid.
